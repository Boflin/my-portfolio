! This is a quick mock up of a website used by customers to order deliveries from a company. 

Inspiration used from the already existing First Class Delivry (50-50). 

This site is just being used as a way for me to practice and develop my web development skills, I have no interest in launching this service and competing with any other delivery companies. This is purely for fun, and to learn new skills. 

If I do complete this project, and manage to create the linked mobile app as well, I would be completely open in partnering with an already established delivery company to help streamline orders, as well as communication between drivers / dispatch / customers, which will hopefully result in faster less stressful deliveries. 

Thank you,
